## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

I am building a Laptop Based Radar System that is capable of sensing range, doppler, and SAR (Synthetic Aperture) Imaging

## Educational Value Added

Completing this project will give me an introduction into applied electromagnetics, RF Design, signal processing, analog design, and radar system design.

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

I will keep track of my progress in a document that will be linked here: 

## BOM + Component Cost

In Progress

## Timeline

11/12-11/18: Build different stages of the circuit with the parts I have available to me 
11/18-11/27: Get Ordered parts in and continue building the different stages of the circuit 
11/27-12/6: Finish construction of the radar and begin testing the accuracy of the range sensing, doppler, and SAR Imaging
